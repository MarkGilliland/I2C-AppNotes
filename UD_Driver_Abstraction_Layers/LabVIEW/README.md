These LabVIEW .vi files abstract the direct usage of LabJacks UD Library that is used to communicate with the U3, U6, and UE9 devices.  These LabVIEW .vi files require many of the files that are distributed in our [LabVIEW Examples](https://labjack.com/support/software/examples/ud/labview) and will not work properly if they haven't already been downloaded.

These .vi files were created in LabVIEW 7.1.
